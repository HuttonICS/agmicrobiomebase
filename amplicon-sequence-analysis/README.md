# Amplicon Sequencing Analysis

This subfolder contains the information and preparation for the amplicon sequencing analysis, which is a method to study the diversity and taxonomy of microorganisms by targeting specific regions of their DNA. The subfolder consists of the following folders:

**amplicon-16s**: The markdown and .sh files for 16s sequencing process, which targets the 16S rRNA gene of bacteria and archaea.

**amplicon-ITS**: The markdown and .sh files for ITS sequencing process, which targets the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the rRNA gene of fungi.

**fastq_checklist_mapping**: The scripts that are used for the checklist preparation for ENA sequencing data upload, which is a requirement for submitting the sequencing data to the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA).
