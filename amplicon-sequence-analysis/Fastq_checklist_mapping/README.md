# Fastq Checklist Mapping

This subfolder contains the information and scripts for the fastq checklist mapping, which is a process to format and validate the metadata of the sequencing data before uploading it to the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA). This is a requirement for submitting the sequencing data to the ENA, which is a public repository that stores and distributes nucleotide sequences and related information.

The subfolder consists of the following files:

**Checklist_GSC-MIxS_16Samplicons_OR_TESTv1.tsv**: A tab-separated file that contains the metadata fields and values for each sample, following the GSC MIxS 16S Amplicons checklist.

**Webin-accessions-2023-12-07T15_42_52.222Z_OR.txt**: A text file that contains the accession numbers assigned by the Webin submission portal for each sample, study, experiment, and run.

**md5.txt**: A text file that contains the MD5 checksums for each fastq file in the directory, generated by the md5sum command. The MD5 checksum is a 32-digit hexadecimal number that represents the unique fingerprint of a file, and it can be used to verify the integrity and authenticity of a file.

**fastq_checklist_mapping.Rmd**: An R markdown file that contains the code and documentation for the fastq checklist mapping process. It can be rendered as a PDF file or other formats.

**fastq_checklist_mapping.md**: A markdown file that shows the output and results of the fastq checklist mapping process, generated by the fastq_checklist_mapping.Rmd file. It includes the merged data frame of the metadata and the accession numbers, and the validation report of the fastq checklist.
