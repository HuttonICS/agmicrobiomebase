This folder contains several sub-folders, each representing a different case study in the analysis of 16S and ITS microbiome data using R scripts. Here's a brief description of each:

- `case_00-preparation`: This folder contains R scripts for setting up the environment and preparing the data for analysis.

- `case_00_02_RData`: This folder is a collection of three R workspace files that correspond to the first three case studies . These workspace files store the objects that can be loaded into the R environment for each case study.

- `case_01-influence_of_soil_type`: This folder contains the R scripts for analysis investigating the influence of soil type on the 16S microbiome. It includes scripts for data processing, statistical analysis, and visualisation of results.

- `case_02-core_microbiome`: This folder focuses on the R scripts for analysis of the core 16S microbiome across different samples. It includes scripts for identifying the core microbiome and performing statistical comparisons.

- `case_03-ITS_wheat`: This folder contains the R scripts for analysis of the ITS region of wheat microbiome. 

Please refer to the individual README files in each sub-folder for more detailed information about the specific analyses.
