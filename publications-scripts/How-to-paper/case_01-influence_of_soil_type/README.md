# How-to Guide: Case Study 1 - Sugar Beet and Soil Type Influence

This directory contains the scripts and documentation for a study on sugar beet, a member of the brassica family, cultivated for its sucrose-rich tuber. The study examines the influence of soil type and locale on the crop and investigates the rhizosphere effect by comparing the microbial diversity of the sugar beet rhizosphere with bulk soil.
