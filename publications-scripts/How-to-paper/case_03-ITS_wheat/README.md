# How-to Guide: Case Study 3 - Investigating Soil-Borne Fungal Diseases in Wheat
This folder contains the scripts in R and R markdown, as well as markdown documentation for the process of analyzing soil-borne fungal diseases in wheat crops using ITS (Internal Transcribed Spacer) sequencing data. The analysis aims to identify the core microbiome associated with wheat and understand the influence of soil type on fungal diversity.

## Contents
Case_03-ITS.R: The R script with all the necessary code to preprocess, analyse, and visualise the ITS sequence data.

Case_03-ITS.Rmd: The R Markdown file that provides a dynamic report combining code, results, and narrative text.

Case_03-ITS.md: The markdown file that documents the methodology, results, and conclusions.

ITS-meta-table.txt: The metadata table associated with the ITS sequence data.

Case_03-ITS_files/figure-markdown_strict: This directory contains all figures generated by the markdown file.
