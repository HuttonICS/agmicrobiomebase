# Shotgun Metagenomics Analysis

This subfolder contains the information and preparation for the Shotgun Metagenomics sequencing analysis. 


The subfolder consists of the following folders:

[**fastq_checklist_mapping**](https://github.com/paytonyau/agmicrobiomebase/tree/main/amplicon-sequence-analysis/fastq_checklist_mapping): The scripts that are used for the checklist preparation for ENA sequencing data upload, which is a requirement for submitting the sequencing data to the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA).

[**fastq_checklist_mapping**](https://github.com/paytonyau/agmicrobiomebase/tree/main/amplicon-sequence-analysis/ENA_fastq_seq_upload): The folder contains`UpENA.sh` that is a tool designed to simplify the process of uploading large FASTQ files to the ENA. It was created by [Micha Bayer](https://www.hutton.ac.uk/staff/micha-bayer) to streamline the data upload process, and for this, we express our gratitude for his valuable contribution to the scientific community.
