# Scripts for Publications

This subfolder contains the information for the analysis scripts that are for publications. These scripts are used to generate the results and figures for the papers that we write based on our research project. The subfolder consists of the following folders:

How-to-paper: A folder that contains a how-to-guide paper that explains the steps and methods for conducting the amplicon sequencing analysis. It also includes the markdown and .sh files for the 16s and ITS sequencing processes, as well as the fastq checklist mapping script for the ENA sequencing data upload.
